# Learn to Design a Neural Network 🎥🧠

This repository contains all the **code and Jupyter notebooks** for the YouTube series  
**[Learn to Design a Neural Network](https://youtube.com/@learndataa)** by *learndataa*.

The series follows a clear step-by-step approach — starting with the simplest single-input neuron, and gradually building up to full neural network models.
